# Use case architecture
A proof of concept PHP application architecture that uses use cases instead of a more traditional MVC approach.

## Project structure
This project uses two PHP projects. One project (`framework`) holds the actual use case and API framework. Another project (`example-api`) holds all the code for a simple example API.
